<h1>Current Research</h1>
<h2>Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs)</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) students have historically learned technical skills through instructional laboratory courses. 
  In many cases, these courses ask  the students to complete pre-prescribed protocols, where the instructor and students know the expected outcome. 
  The level of inquiry in these recipe "cookbook" style labs is relatively low. Additionally, if a student does not get the expected result, they do not 
  typically troubleshoot the issue and try again. Cookbook style experiments do not fully prepare students to work with real world problems that occur in STEM careers. 
  </p>
  <h3>What is a CURE?</h3>
  <p>CUREs have emerged in laboratory instruction to introduce high level of inquiry and build troubleshooting and critical thinking skills while 
  also mimicking real-world laboratory workplaces. CUREs bring an authentic research experience into the course. They have also been shown to improve students’ 
  sense of belonging, understand what research really is like, and take ownership over their work. There are five components that make up a CURE: scientific 
  practices, relevance outside the classroom, discovery, iteration, and collaboration. Despite the many benefits and interest in CUREs, it has not been explicitly
   shown that they develop better laboratory skills than a traditional course. </p>
  <h3>Curriculum</h3>
   <p>I have built a CURE-based curriculum for General Chemistry II laboratory based on the metal adsorption capacity of biochar, a possible 
   activated carbon alternative. The first half of the semester teaches the students research skills and laboratory techniques to be able
    to do the CURE in the second half of the semester. The students learn how to find research articles, read the articles they find, develop a
    research question and hypothesis, create an experimental proposal to execute during the CURE, and how to present their work both in written
    and oral formats. At the end of the CURE the students write a report and do a poster presentation about their progress throughout the CURE. </p>
<h3>Our three research questions:</h3>
      <ol>
  <li>Does the CURE develop the students’ experimental design skills more than a traditional lab?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Experimental Design Ability Test</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Does the CURE develop the students’ laboratory technique more than a traditional lab?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Digital Badging</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Is there a Dunning Kruger Effect in the student's laboratory skills? If so, is this lessened by the CURE curriculum?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Comparing self-assessments to actual scores</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
